## 🪔 Significance

This is one of the most revered mantras to **Lord Ganesha** from the **Yajurveda (Taittiriya Aranyaka 10.11.1)**. It is traditionally chanted at the beginning of Vedic rituals to invoke Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and the lord of beginnings.

- **Gaṇapati** is hailed as the chief of the ganas (divine beings).
- He is addressed as a **wise sage among sages**, **the most famous**, and **the eldest ruler of prayers**.
- The mantra invites him to **dwell in the sacred seat of worship** and bless the chanter with guidance and protection.

This chant is particularly suited for **initiating study, rituals, or spiritual learning**, making it a perfect first chant for this website.
